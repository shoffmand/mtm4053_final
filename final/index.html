The North-South Institute’s Canadian International Development Platform</h4>

					<p>Open data in the international development sector is growing by leaps and bounds. However, to make sense of this data and the possibilities it offers it needs to be made available to a broader community of users in engaging ways. We have seen that the real game-changer is when we join disparate data streams in new and interesting ways.</p>

					<p>This project will focus on building a new website and visualization of Canada’s foreign aid projects and initiatives around the world. It will build a visual layer on top of our new API that links to a vast array of data sources (including data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative). Linking through the API will ensure access to “real-time” data, which will not only improve transparency and accountability to Canadian taxpayers who fund these initiatives; it will also shed more light on these for our partners in developing countries.</p>
